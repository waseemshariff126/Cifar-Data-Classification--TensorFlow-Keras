# Cifar-Data-Classification--TensorFlow-Keras

The repository contains simple tensorflow keras model classifying Cifar 10 images. The model classifies 4 objects (bird, cat, dog, horse). CIFAR-10  is an established computer-vision dataset used for object recognition. It is a subset of the 80 million tiny images dataset and consists of 60,000 32x32 color images containing one of 10 object classes, with 6000 images per class.
